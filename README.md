In this project I've implemented various models for training and evaluation. The models include state of art like BERT, RoBERTa etc. as well as data preprocessing pipeline.

## Run
`python main.py -file_path='../train.csv' -mode='train' -epochs=10 -model='xlnet' -optimizer='adamw' -bs=16`

## Dataset
The dataset has been taken from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data).
